        "Credit card plays a major role in the Banking sector, It is one of the hottest department under any banks as it serves a significant source of revenue through interest charges and fees, Also it helps banks to build customer relationship as credit cards provide several discounts, gift vouchers and help them build their credit score. Since credit card benifits both customers and banks it is important that banks must take a great care while issuing these cards.Lot of parameters about the individual needs to analyzed before its been given to them.A Machine learning model can be of great deal in the case of predicting the right person for getting a credit card. An effective Machine Learning model that could classify the eligible person for credit card will be a game changer in the Banking sector as it will reduce the screening time drastically. This will help the banks to identify the persons who are eligible in a much faster and hastle free way which in turn make them more focused on customer satisfaction and other important factors that could help them grow their business. A Machine learning model will make use of multiple factors about an\n",

In addition to the existing features given in the dataset Loan status (whether the person have taken a loan or not) and Credit score about the person would have added more advantage for the model prediction."
